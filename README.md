# LMS1-Website

#### Fall Semester 2020 - CSE 435

This website was made for CSE 435. It is the homepage for our project, the Lane Management System. 
It features the project background, description, the team, and links to important documents.

It was designed by me, the webmaster for the project.

The project was developed in visual studio code. HTML, CSS (transpiled from sass), and JS were the only languages used.

Update 12/8/2020: Final website submitted. It will no longer be updated. Was a fun project :)
